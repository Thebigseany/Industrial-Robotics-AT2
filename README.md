# Industrial-Robotics-AT2
Models the FANUC M16-iB robot and Linear UR10 robot in a simulated mineshaft environment. This implementation includes safety features such as collision detection, emergency stops and a GUI for human control of the robots.
This project requires Peter Corke's Robotics Toolbox (Modified by UTS).
